Problem Statement: Streamlining Inventory Management for Municipal Corporations
Background: Municipal corporations manage a wide range of assets, supplies, and equipment necessary
for the delivery of public services. Efficient inventory management is crucial to ensure these resources are
available when needed, minimizing waste, and optimizing costs. However, many municipal corporations
still rely on outdated or manual inventory management systems, leading to several inefficiencies.
Description: Current manual and outdated inventory management systems in municipal corporations lead
to resource shortages, excess stock, increased costs, and reduced operational efficiency. Errors and delays
in manual tracking make it challenging to maintain accurate records, resulting in critical supplies being
unavailable or overstocked. The proposed inventory management system will enhance the efficiency,
accuracy, and reliability of inventory management in municipal corporations, leading to better resource
allocation, reduced costs, and improved service delivery.
